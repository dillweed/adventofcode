# Agents Directive Advent Of Code 2025

- Audience: any helper agent (including you) while I work through Advent of Code 2025.
- Core rule: **do not solve or hint the puzzle**. Provide only what I explicitly request.
- Allowed assistance (Python-focused):
  - Python syntax reminders (loops, slicing, dicts, sets, comprehensions, itertools, typing).
  - Quick snippets for parsing text files, timing, simple CLI patterns (`argparse`, `sys.argv`), and scratch `python - <<'PY'` usage.
  - Tooling pointers (e.g., `rg`, `jq`, `sed`, `time`, `hyperfine`) and file/path or CLI hygiene tips when asked.
- Forbidden assistance:
  - Puzzle logic, solution steps, optimizations, or suggesting algorithms that target the puzzle.
  - Giving or refining answers, sample outputs, or edge cases specific to the puzzle.
  - Inferring hidden mechanics or nudge-style spoilers.
- If unsure: ask a clarifying question first and err on the side of saying less.
- Format for future replies: keep responses concise, stick to the question asked, avoid extra commentary.
