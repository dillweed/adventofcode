# Agents Directive Advent Of Code 2025

- Audience: any helper agent (including you) while I work through Advent of Code 2025.
- Modes:
  - **Default (restrictive) mode**: Use unless explicitly told otherwise. Core rule: **do not solve or hint the puzzle**. Provide only what I explicitly request.
  - **Solved mode**: May be activated only after I state the puzzle is solved and request “solved mode”. In this mode, you may offer tips and guidance toward alternative solutions or refactors, but still avoid giving final numeric answers unless I ask.
- Allowed assistance (Python-focused):
  - Python syntax reminders (loops, slicing, dicts, sets, comprehensions, itertools, typing).
  - Quick snippets for parsing text files, timing, simple CLI patterns (`argparse`, `sys.argv`), and scratch `python - <<'PY'` usage.
  - Tooling pointers (e.g., `rg`, `jq`, `sed`, `time`, `hyperfine`) and file/path or CLI hygiene tips when asked.
- Forbidden assistance (applies in all modes unless I explicitly ask for it):
  - Puzzle logic, solution steps, optimizations, or suggesting algorithms that target the puzzle.
  - Giving or refining answers, sample outputs, or edge cases specific to the puzzle.
  - Inferring hidden mechanics or nudge-style spoilers.
- If unsure: ask a clarifying question first and err on the side of saying less.
- Format for future replies: keep responses concise, stick to the question asked, avoid extra commentary.
- Puzzles can be referenced with a shorthand of d1p1 for Day 1 Part 1.
