**Session Summary (Dec 6, 2025)**

- Consolidated Advent of Code repos: removed nested `.git` in `2025/`, staged under parent repo, pushed to `origin/main`; handled empty dir with `.gitkeep`.
- Implemented Zsh solutions: `p1.zsh` and a streamlined `p1_fast.zsh` (modular dial logic, safe parsing, zero count). Added timing guidance using `time`/`TIMEFMT`.
- Implemented concise Python solver `p1_fast.py`; verified result `992`.
- Clarified shell/Python syntax: shebang with `env`, `set -euo pipefail`, `case`, arithmetic `%` wrap, `main "$@"`, handling EOF with `|| true`, `argv`, `dir_`, blank-line `continue`.
- Updated `Agents.md` for Day 1 Part 2 with Python-focused, no-spoilers rules.
